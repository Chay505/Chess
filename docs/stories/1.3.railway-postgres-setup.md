## Dev Notes

### Railway Setup
- **Service:** Railway PostgreSQL
- **Pricing:** $5-20/month (usage-based)
- **Features:** Automatic backups, SSL connections, environment variable management

### Environment Variables
Required variables for `.env.local`:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"
```

### Connection Pooling
- **Vercel Serverless:** Use connection pooling to avoid exhausting database connections
- **Recommended:** Add `?pgbouncer=true` or configure max connections appropriately
- **Reference:** https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management

### SSL Configuration
- **Required:** All production connections must use SSL
- **Connection String:** Add `?sslmode=require` parameter
- **Verification:** Test connection with SSL enabled

### Testing
- **Connection Test:** Create simple Node.js script to test DATABASE_URL connection
- **SSL Verification:** Ensure connection fails without SSL
- **Environment Isolation:** Separate development and production databases

- `package.json` - Modified: Added `pg` and `dotenv` devDependencies

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** Infrastructure setup is functionally complete and well-documented. Database connection is verified working with proper SSL and connection pooling configuration. However, the implementation has architectural violations and gaps that should be addressed before building dependent features.

**Key Strengths:**
- Excellent documentation in `.env.example` with comprehensive security notes
- Clear separation of internal vs public database URLs
- Well-implemented test script with good error handling and helpful output
- Proper connection pooling configuration for Vercel serverless architecture

**Critical Issues:**
- Violates coding standard requiring `lib/config.ts` for environment variable access (direct `process.env` usage)
- No verification evidence for AC7 (Railway production environment configuration)
- SSL security tradeoff (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) not documented in architecture decisions

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `scripts/test-db-connection.js:57-58`
  - **Change**: Updated SSL error message to reflect actual implementation (`rejectUnauthorized: false`)
  - **Why**: Original message suggested `sslmode=require` which contradicts the actual SSL configuration approach
  - **How**: Changed error tip to guide users to verify `{ rejectUnauthorized: false }` configuration for Railway

- **File**: `package.json:17`
  - **Change**: Added `"test:db": "node scripts/test-db-connection.js"` npm script
  - **Why**: Makes database connectivity test easily accessible and documentable for CI/CD integration
  - **How**: Added new script entry to make test execution standardized (`npm run test:db`)

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✗ FAIL - Direct `process.env` access violates requirement for `lib/config.ts` abstraction (coding-standards.md:7)
- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS - Files organized appropriately (scripts/, .env.example)
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ CONCERNS - Manual test script exists but not integrated into automated test suite (no Vitest tests)
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ CONCERNS - AC1-6 verified, AC7 lacks concrete evidence

### Requirements Traceability

| AC # | Requirement | Status | Test Coverage | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Railway account & PostgreSQL provisioned | ✅ PASS | Manual verification via test script | PostgreSQL 17.6 confirmed running |
| 2 | DATABASE_URL in `.env.local` (excluded from Git) | ✅ PASS | Manual verification | Properly excluded in `.gitignore:33` |
| 3 | SSL connection enforced | ✅ PASS | Automated test script | `rejectUnauthorized: false` for Railway certs |
| 4 | Database accessible from local environment | ✅ PASS | Automated test script | Connection successful via `npm run test:db` |
| 5 | Connection pooling configured | ✅ PASS | Automated test script | `pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1` validated |
| 6 | `.env.example` created | ✅ PASS | Manual review | Comprehensive documentation with security notes |
| 7 | Railway production environment variables | ⚠️ CONCERNS | No verification | Mentioned in Dev Notes but no concrete evidence |

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed by QA:**
- [x] Fixed misleading SSL error message in test script (scripts/test-db-connection.js:57-58)
- [x] Added `test:db` npm script for standardized test execution (package.json:17)

**Must Address (Before Dependent Stories):**
- [ ] Create `lib/config.ts` for environment variable abstraction per coding standards
- [ ] Refactor test script to use `lib/config.ts` instead of direct `process.env`
- [ ] Verify and document Railway production environment variable configuration (AC7)
- [ ] Document SSL `rejectUnauthorized: false` decision in `docs/architecture/decisions/`

**Recommended (Future Stories):**
- [ ] Create Prisma schema and integrate ORM (dependency for data model stories)
- [ ] Add database connectivity test to automated Vitest suite
- [ ] Implement database monitoring and alerting strategy
- [ ] Document backup/recovery procedures for production database
- [ ] Add connection retry logic for production resilience

### Security Review

**Status**: CONCERNS

**Findings:**
1. ✅ **PASS** - `.env.local` properly excluded from Git (`.gitignore:33`)
2. ✅ **PASS** - Password masking implemented in test script output
3. ⚠️ **CONCERN** - SSL configuration uses `rejectUnauthorized: false` for Railway's self-signed certificates (acceptable but needs architectural documentation)
4. ⚠️ **CONCERN** - No verification that production uses different credentials than development
5. ⚠️ **CONCERN** - No encryption-at-rest verification for Railway PostgreSQL
6. ⚠️ **CONCERN** - Connection string contains credentials (industry standard but sensitive)

**Recommendation:** Document the SSL security tradeoff in architecture decisions and verify production credential separation.

### Performance Considerations

**Status**: PASS

**Findings:**
1. ✅ Connection pooling properly configured with `pgbouncer=true`
2. ✅ Connection limit appropriate for Vercel serverless (`connection_limit=1`)
3. ✅ Follows Prisma documentation best practices for serverless environments
4. ✅ PostgreSQL 17.6 provides modern performance optimizations

**No performance concerns identified.**

### Reliability Considerations

**Status**: CONCERNS

**Findings:**
1. ⚠️ **CONCERN** - No backup/failover strategy documented
2. ⚠️ **CONCERN** - No monitoring or alerting configured for database health
3. ⚠️ **CONCERN** - Test script lacks connection retry logic
4. ⚠️ **CONCERN** - Single point of failure (no redundancy strategy)
5. ✅ **PASS** - Good error handling in test script

**Recommendation:** Create a follow-up story for database observability, backup strategy, and disaster recovery planning.

### Files Modified During Review

QA modified the following files during review (Dev should verify and update File List if needed):
- `scripts/test-db-connection.js` - Fixed SSL error message (line 57-58)
- `package.json` - Added `test:db` npm script (line 17)

### Gate Status

**Gate**: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-railway-postgres-setup.yml
**Quality Score**: 70/100
**Risk Profile**: 1 High, 3 Medium, 2 Low (Highest risk score: 7)

**Gate Decision Rationale:**
Infrastructure is functionally complete and database connectivity is verified working. However, architectural standard violations (missing `lib/config.ts`) and gaps in production verification (AC7) prevent a PASS gate. Security and reliability concerns exist but are not blocking for MVP. The immediate issues must be resolved before building dependent database integration features.

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Changes Required** - Address checklist items marked "Must Address" before proceeding to dependent stories.

**Justification:**
- Core functionality works (database accessible with SSL and pooling)
- Architectural violations should be fixed to maintain codebase consistency
- AC7 verification gap should be closed for audit trail
- Current state is acceptable for continued development but not production-ready

Story owner decides final status. If time-constrained, consider creating a follow-up technical debt story for the "Must Address" items.
