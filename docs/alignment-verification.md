# PRD-Architecture Alignment Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Verified By:** Sarah (Product Owner)
**Status:** ✅ **ALIGNED**

---

## Executive Summary

The PRD and Architecture documents have been verified for complete alignment. **One critical misalignment was identified and resolved**: the Next.js version specification was updated from "14+" to "15+" across all PRD documents to match the Architecture's commitment to Next.js 15.1.8.

**Result:** PRD and Architecture are now **100% aligned** and ready for development.

## Technical Risk Mitigation Alignment

| PRD Identified Risk | Architecture Mitigation |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| File upload security | Zod validation, 50MB enforcement, auth verification |
| Role-based access | Clerk metadata with middleware route matching |
| BYTEA file size limits | Validation in API routes before database write |
| Database connection pooling | Prisma singleton with `connection_limit=1` for serverless |
| Bilingual routing complexity | next-intl middleware integration with Clerk |

---

## Project Structure Alignment

**PRD Expectation:** Monorepo with frontend/backend in single Next.js project
**Architecture Implementation:** Unified project structure with `app/` directory containing both pages and API routes

**Key Structure Verified:**
- ✅ `app/[locale]/` for locale-based routing
- ✅ `app/api/` for Route Handlers
- ✅ `lib/services/` for business logic layer
- ✅ `lib/repositories/` for data access abstraction
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` for database models
- ✅ `messages/` for bilingual translations
- ✅ `middleware.ts` for Clerk + next-intl integration

---

## Testing Strategy Alignment

**PRD Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests: Vitest ✅ (Architecture: Vitest for components/services)
- Integration tests: Playwright ✅ (Architecture: Playwright 1.49+)
- Focus: File upload/download with auth ✅ (Architecture: Documented in testing strategy)

---

## Deployment Alignment

**PRD Deployment:**
- Vercel for Next.js ✅
- Railway for PostgreSQL ✅
- Automatic deployments ✅
- Preview environments ✅

**Architecture Deployment:**

## Conclusion

### Alignment Status: ✅ **FULLY ALIGNED**

The PRD and Architecture documents are now completely synchronized. All functional requirements map to architectural components, all non-functional requirements have implementation strategies, and all technical decisions are consistent across both documents.

### Readiness Assessment

**Development Readiness:** ✅ **READY**
**Story Implementation Readiness:** ✅ **READY**
**Technical Stack Clarity:** ✅ **CLEAR**

### Next Steps for Development Team

1. **Proceed with Epic 1 Story 1.1:** Initialize Next.js 15 project
2. **Reference Architecture for Implementation:** Use unified project structure as blueprint
3. **Follow Prisma Schema:** Implement exactly as specified in `docs/architecture/data-models.md`
4. **Implement API Routes:** Match specifications in `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`
5. **Use Tech Stack Table:** Reference `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` for exact versions
