# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Streamline client acquisition and lesson management for chess coaching business
- Eliminate administrative overhead through automated booking and payment workflows
- Present a professional, bilingual (FR/EN) online presence to attract beginner chess learners
- Provide authenticated client portal for organized resource delivery and post-lesson feedback
- Enable 24/7 booking availability without manual scheduling coordination
- Build scalable coaching platform that grows from solo operation to potential multi-coach business

## Background Context

Chess instructors currently face fragmented workflows that limit growth and create friction. Scheduling happens through scattered channels (email, messaging apps), consuming 8-12 hours monthly. Resources get lost across platforms, and without professional web presence, an estimated 20-30% of prospects never convert. The online chess coaching market has expanded significantly post-pandemic, making professional digital presence increasingly essential.

This platform centralizes four essential functions: public-facing marketing, intelligent scheduling with Calendly integration, simple payment processing via Stripe payment links, and an authenticated client portal. The solution targets beginner chess learners (ages 5-55, rating 0-1200) seeking personalized instruction at $40/hour, with full bilingual support serving both French and English markets.
