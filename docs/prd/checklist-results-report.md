# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 85%
**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right (after simplification)
**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready with Minor Refinements
**Most Critical Gaps:** Business goals/success metrics need quantification; some non-functional requirements need tightening

## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:**
None - PRD is ready for architecture phase

**HIGH:**
1. Add specific success criteria for demo validation
2. Document manual student onboarding process (how instructor creates accounts after Calendly booking)

**MEDIUM:**
1. Consider adding user analytics/monitoring approach for future
2. Document content creation timeline for bilingual pages

**LOW:**
1. Add monitoring strategy documentation
2. Consider adding deployment rollback procedures

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Current Scope (4 Epics):**
✅ **Appropriate for Demo** - Simplified structure eliminates over-engineering

**Features Correctly Cut:**
- Webhook automation (Calendly → Stripe)
- Booking status database tracking
- Payment confirmation automation
- Complex integration testing

**Essential Features Retained:**
- Public website with Calendly
- Student portal (resources + feedback)
- Instructor admin (upload files, post feedback)
- Clerk authentication

**Complexity Assessment:**
- Epic 1: Medium (infrastructure setup always has complexity)
- Epic 2: Low (static content + Calendly embed)
- Epic 3: Medium (Clerk integration + file downloads)
- Epic 4: Medium (file uploads with PostgreSQL BYTEA)

**Timeline Realism:**
4-6 weeks for experienced Next.js developer, 6-8 weeks for learning developer

## Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:** ✅ Excellent
- Stack: Next.js 14+, Prisma, Railway Postgres, Clerk, Tailwind
- File storage: PostgreSQL BYTEA (50MB limit)
- Hosting: Vercel
- Budget: $5-20/month

**Identified Technical Risks:**
1. **PostgreSQL BYTEA file storage** - 50MB limit must be enforced in code
2. **Clerk role-based access** - Instructor vs. Student distinction needs proper implementation
3. **File serving via API routes** - Must implement authentication checks correctly

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
1. File upload/download API route security patterns
2. Clerk middleware configuration for role-based routing
3. Bilingual routing strategy (path-based vs. domain-based)

## Recommendations

**Before Architect Handoff:**

1. **Add Manual Workflow Documentation** (10 min):
   - Document: Student books via Calendly → Instructor receives email → Instructor manually sends Stripe link → Instructor creates student account in admin panel

2. **Clarify Demo Success Criteria** (5 min):
   - Add specific validation checklist (e.g., "Demo successful if: student can book, instructor can upload file, student can download file")

**For Architect:**
- Proceed with architecture design
- Focus on: File upload/download security, Clerk role implementation, PostgreSQL BYTEA handling
- Design API route structure for authenticated file serving

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD has been appropriately simplified for demo scope. Epic structure is clean (4 epics), requirements are testable, and technical stack is well-defined. Minor documentation improvements recommended but don't block architectural design work.
