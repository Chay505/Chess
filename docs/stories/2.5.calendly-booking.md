## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### CRITICAL FINDING: Story Not Implemented

**Status Issue**: Story 2.5 is marked as "Approved" but has **zero implementation**. The story status is misleading.

**Missing Implementation**:
- ❌ No `Booking.tsx` component exists in `/app/components/`
- ❌ No Calendly integration (react-calendly package not installed)
- ❌ No booking translation keys in `messages/en.json` or `messages/fr.json`
- ❌ No booking section integrated into `app/[locale]/page.tsx`
- ❌ No test files for Booking component
- ❌ No actual Calendly event configured (external configuration required)
- ❌ Dev Agent Record section completely empty (no model, debug log, completion notes, or file list)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Profile**: CRITICAL (Story falsely marked complete)

| Risk Category | Score (1-10) | Impact |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| **Delivery Risk** | 10 | Story marked "Approved" but 0% implemented - misleading status blocks project visibility |
| **Technical Risk** | 3 | Implementation is straightforward (Calendly embed) once started |
| **Dependency Risk** | 5 | Requires external Calendly account setup and configuration |
| **Testing Risk** | 8 | No tests exist; manual testing required for responsive/i18n validation |

**Highest Risk**: Delivery risk due to misleading story status.

### Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then)

All acceptance criteria **LACK implementation**:

| AC | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|----|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Widget embedded on dedicated page/section | ❌ Not implemented | FAIL |
| 2 | Display real-time availability | ❌ Not implemented | FAIL |
| 3 | "1-on-1 Chess Lesson" event type configured | ❌ Not configured | FAIL |
| 4 | Widget styled to match branding | ❌ Not implemented | FAIL |
| 5 | Form collects name, email, optional message | ❌ Not implemented | FAIL |
| 6 | Confirmation displayed with next steps | ❌ Not implemented | FAIL |
| 7 | Responsive on mobile devices | ❌ Not implemented | FAIL |
| 8 | Language follows site locale | ❌ Not implemented | FAIL |
| 9 | Instructional text included | ❌ Not implemented | FAIL |

**Coverage Summary**: 0/9 acceptance criteria met (0%)

### Code Quality Assessment

**N/A** - No code exists to assess.

### Refactoring Performed

**None** - No code exists to refactor.

### Compliance Check

- ❌ **Coding Standards**: N/A (no code to check)
- ❌ **Project Structure**: Missing component at `/app/components/Booking.tsx`
- ❌ **Testing Strategy**: No tests written (required per BMAD-TDD workflow)
- ❌ **All ACs Met**: 0/9 acceptance criteria implemented

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage**: NONE

Required tests missing:
1. **Unit Tests** (`/app/tests/components/Booking.test.tsx`):
   - Booking component renders
   - Instructional text displays in correct locale (EN/FR)
   - Calendly widget receives correct props
   - Responsive layout classes applied

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Booking section integrated into homepage
   - Section positioned after Testimonials
   - Scroll navigation to #booking anchor works

3. **E2E Tests** (Playwright - recommended):
   - Complete booking flow on desktop
   - Complete booking flow on mobile
   - FR/EN language switching works
   - Widget touch interactions on mobile

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

| NFR Category | Status | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Security** | N/A | Calendly handles form submissions (external service) |
| **Performance** | CONCERNS | react-calendly adds ~50KB to bundle; lazy loading recommended |
| **Reliability** | CONCERNS | Depends on Calendly API availability (no fallback UI specified) |
| **Maintainability** | N/A | No code to assess |
| **Accessibility** | UNKNOWN | Calendly widget accessibility needs validation with keyboard navigation tests |

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Missing Package Dependency**: `react-calendly` not installed
2. **Missing Translations**: No `booking` namespace in i18n files
3. **Missing External Configuration**: Calendly event type setup required (external to codebase)
4. **Missing Error Handling**: No graceful degradation if Calendly fails to load

### Blocking Conditions Met

✅ **Review should be stopped** - Multiple blocking conditions:
1. Story marked "Approved" but implementation is 0% complete
2. Dev Agent Record section is completely empty (no model, debug log, file list)
3. No tests exist when story requires TDD approach (BMAD-METHOD)
4. Story status does not align with actual completion state

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (MUST FIX)

1. **Correct Story Status**: Change status from "Approved" to "In Progress" or "To Do"
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install react-calendly
   ```
3. **Create Booking Component** (`/app/components/Booking.tsx`):
   - Follow example code in Dev Notes section
   - Use `next-intl` for translations
   - Configure Calendly widget with branding colors

4. **Write Tests FIRST** (TDD Approach):
   - Create `/app/tests/components/Booking.test.tsx`
   - Test rendering, i18n, and props
   - Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle

5. **Add Translation Keys**:
   ```json
   // messages/en.json & messages/fr.json
   {
     "booking": {
       "heading": "Book Your First Lesson",
       "instructions": "Select a convenient time below...",
       "note": "Having trouble? Contact us..."
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Integrate into Homepage** (`app/[locale]/page.tsx`):
   - Import Booking component
   - Position after Testimonials component
   - Add section ID for anchor navigation

7. **Configure External Calendly Account**:
   - Create "1-on-1 Chess Lesson" event type
   - Set 60-minute duration, $40/hour description
   - Configure confirmation message
   - Set up FR/EN language support if available

#### Future Improvements (CAN ADDRESS LATER)

1. Add lazy loading for Calendly widget to improve initial page load
2. Add fallback UI if Calendly widget fails to load
3. Add E2E tests with Playwright for booking flow
4. Consider Calendly webhook integration for automated email confirmations (future story)

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → `docs/qa/gates/2.5-calendly-booking.yml`

### Recommended Status

❌ **Changes Required - Implementation Missing**

**Story owner must**:
1. Correct status from "Approved" to "In Progress"
2. Follow TDD workflow (BMAD-METHOD Gate 2: write tests before implementation)
3. Complete all 9 acceptance criteria
4. Update Dev Agent Record section with model, debug log, completion notes, and file list
5. Request re-review when implementation is complete

---

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This story cannot proceed to "Done" status until full implementation is complete and all tests pass. Current "Approved" status is misleading and must be corrected immediately.
