# Quality Gate Decision - Story 3.1: Clerk Authentication Setup
schema: 1
story: "3.1"
story_title: "Clerk Authentication Setup"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Production-ready implementation with excellent code quality, but missing E2E tests for critical authentication flows. Minor route naming discrepancy (/sign-in vs /login) acceptable as it follows Clerk framework convention."

    notes: "Clerk provides industry-standard auth security. Missing rate limiting and session timeout documentation. CSRF protection handled by Clerk (needs verification)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minimal bundle impact, server-side auth check, lazy-loaded Clerk SDK. Production build optimized successfully."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 18 unit tests passing. Clerk SDK is production-proven. Build succeeds without errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, proper separation of concerns, adequate unit test coverage, clear documentation in story."
