# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Chess Coaching Platform, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Project Status:** N/A - Greenfield project (no starter template currently specified)

**Analysis:**
- The PRD specifies Next.js 14+ with App Router, which suggests using the official Next.js starter
- You're building a monolith fullstack application (not microservices)
- Vercel deployment is planned (optimal for Next.js)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM is specified
- Clerk authentication is required

**Recommendation:**

Using the **official Next.js 15 TypeScript template** rather than a complex starter like T3 Stack, because:

1. **Simplicity:** Your PRD is well-defined and doesn't need T3's opinionated choices
2. **Learning curve:** Standard Next.js is easier to understand and customize
3. **Flexibility:** You can add Prisma, Clerk, and Tailwind incrementally
4. **Documentation:** Official Next.js docs are comprehensive and current

**Rationale:** Your PRD already makes clear architectural decisions, so a minimal starter gives you maximum control without fighting pre-configured opinions.
