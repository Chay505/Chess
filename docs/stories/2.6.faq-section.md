All 8 FAQ items address required topics with friendly, beginner-focused tone.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required. Code is production-ready as implemented.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ PascalCase component naming, correct file structure
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Files in correct ERGIR locations (app/components/, app/tests/components/)
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ Vitest + React Testing Library, 11 tests passing
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ 7 of 7 required ACs covered (AC7 search marked optional for MVP)

### Requirements Traceability

| AC | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC1 | 8-10 FAQ items bilingual | ✅ "renders 8 FAQ items", i18n provider | COVERED |
| AC2 | Topics covered (8 topics) | ✅ "covers all required topics" | COVERED |

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Strengths:**
- 11 comprehensive tests covering functional, responsive, accessibility, and content aspects
- Proper use of `userEvent` for interaction testing
- Well-structured test suite with clear assertions
- i18n integration validated with mock provider

**Future Enhancements (optional, non-blocking):**
- Consider adding explicit keyboard navigation tests (Tab, Enter, Space keys)
- Consider integrating jest-axe for automated accessibility audits

### Security Review

✅ **PASS** - No security concerns. Static content component with no user input, authentication, or external API calls. React provides XSS protection by default.
