# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.3: Railway Postgres Database Setup
schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "Railway Postgres Database Setup"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Infrastructure successfully provisioned and validated, but missing critical lib/config.ts abstraction and production environment verification (AC7). Security and reliability concerns noted for production readiness."

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Create lib/config.ts to comply with coding standards before next database integration story"
    monitor:
      - "Document SSL security decision in architecture decisions"
      - "Verify Railway production environment configuration"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "SSL rejectUnauthorized: false is acceptable for Railway but needs architectural documentation. No encryption-at-rest verification. Production credentials not verified as separate from development."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Connection pooling properly configured for Vercel serverless with pgbouncer=true and connection_limit=1. Follows Prisma best practices."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No backup/failover strategy, monitoring, or alerting configured. Test script lacks retry logic. Single point of failure."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation in .env.example and Dev Notes. Clear separation of public vs internal URLs. Well-commented test script."

quality_score: 70
