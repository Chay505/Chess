# Additional notes
notes: |
  This story demonstrates exemplary implementation quality:
  - All 7 acceptance criteria fully met with verifiable evidence
  - 19 comprehensive unit tests (100% passing after mock fix)
  - Proper separation of Server/Client Components
  - Full bilingual support via next-intl
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
  - Secure authentication via Clerk middleware
  - Clean code with no technical debt
  - Follows all documented coding standards and project structure

  The only issue found was a test mock export pattern mismatch (fixed during review).
  Story is production-ready and recommended for Done status.
