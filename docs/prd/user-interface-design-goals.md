# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Clean, welcoming, and confidence-inspiring interface that signals professional coaching service while remaining approachable for complete beginners. Design prioritizes clarity and simplicity over chess-specific complexity—students should feel "this is easy to use" rather than overwhelmed. The experience should feel like booking a trusted tutor, not navigating complex software. Bilingual experience (FR/EN) must feel native in both languages, not like a translation overlay.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Minimal-click booking flow:** Public site → embedded Calendly → payment page → portal login (streamlined process)
- **Dashboard-centric student portal:** Single landing page shows "everything I need" (resources, feedback) without deep navigation
- **Drag-and-drop file uploads** for instructor admin panel with clear progress indicators
- **Mobile-first responsive design:** Touch-friendly targets, readable text without zooming, accessible on parent's phone
- **Instant feedback:** Loading states, success confirmations, clear error messages in plain language (not technical jargon)

## Core Screens and Views

**Public Website:**
- Landing page (hero, credentials, testimonials, pricing, embedded Calendly)
- About/Teaching Philosophy page
- Contact/FAQ page
- Payment instructions page

**Student Portal (Authenticated):**
- Student Dashboard (resources, feedback sections)
- Resource Library (filterable/searchable list of uploaded files)
- Feedback History (chronological list of instructor notes)

**Instructor Admin Panel (Authenticated):**
- Student Management (list all students, add new students)
- Student Detail (view individual student, upload resources, post feedback)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Target WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance to ensure platform is accessible to students with disabilities, including:
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Text resizing without loss of functionality
- Clear focus indicators

## Branding

Professional yet approachable chess coaching aesthetic:
- **Color palette:** Calm, trustworthy tones (blues/greens) with chess-inspired accents (black/white contrast elements)
- **Typography:** Clean, readable sans-serif fonts optimized for bilingual content (FR/EN character support)
- **Imagery:** Welcoming photos of diverse age ranges engaged in chess learning (not intimidating grandmaster imagery)
- **Chess elements:** Subtle chess piece iconography for navigation/sections without overwhelming non-chess-players
- **Tone:** Encouraging and educational, avoiding elitist chess culture language

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

- **Primary:** Desktop/laptop browsers (students booking from home computers)
- **Secondary:** Tablets and mobile phones (parents booking for children, on-the-go access)
- **Responsive breakpoints:** Mobile (<640px), Tablet (640-1024px), Desktop (>1024px)
- **Touch optimization:** All interactive elements minimum 44x44px tap targets
- **No native mobile apps for MVP:** Progressive Web App (PWA) features optional for future enhancement
