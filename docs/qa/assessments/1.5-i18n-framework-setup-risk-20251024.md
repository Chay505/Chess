## Detailed Risk Analysis

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### TECH-001: Locale Parameter Async Handling Inconsistency
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability:** High - Next.js 15+ requires async params handling
**Impact:** Medium - Can cause runtime errors in production

**Description:**
The story implementation uses async/await pattern for params destructuring (`params: { locale }`), which is required for Next.js 16.0.0 compatibility. However, inconsistent handling across components could lead to runtime errors.

**Affected Components:**
- `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
- `app/[locale]/page.tsx`
- Any nested route components

**Detection Method:** Code review identified the async params pattern requirement in dev notes.

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive
- **Actions:**
  - Audit all route components for consistent async params handling
  - Add TypeScript strict mode checks for params types
  - Create shared type definitions for locale params
  - Document async params pattern in coding standards
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Unit tests for all route components with various locale values
  - Integration tests covering nested routes
  - TypeScript compilation validation in CI/CD
- **Residual Risk:** Low - Pattern is well-documented in Next.js docs
- **Owner:** Dev
- **Timeline:** Before next feature development

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### BUS-001: SEO Impact from Locale Routing Structure
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability:** Medium - Search engines need proper hreflang configuration
**Impact:** Medium - Can affect organic traffic distribution

**Description:**
The `/[locale]/*` routing structure is SEO-friendly, but missing hreflang tags and alternate URL declarations could impact international SEO performance.

**Affected Components:**
- All pages under `/[locale]`
- Layout metadata configuration
- Sitemap generation

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive
- **Actions:**
  - Add hreflang tags to layout metadata
  - Configure alternate URL links for each locale
  - Generate locale-specific sitemaps
  - Set up proper canonical URLs
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - SEO crawler testing (Google Search Console)
  - Lighthouse SEO audit
  - Manual verification of hreflang tags
- **Residual Risk:** Low - Standard Next.js metadata API handles this well
- **Owner:** Dev + Marketing
- **Timeline:** Before production deployment

---

#### PERF-001: Translation File Loading Performance
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability:** Medium - Dynamic imports can impact initial load
**Impact:** Medium - Could affect page load metrics

**Description:**
Translation files are loaded dynamically using `await import()` in the layout. As the application grows, translation files could become large, impacting initial page load time.

**Affected Components:**
- `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
- `messages/en.json`
- `messages/fr.json`

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive + Detective
- **Actions:**
  - Monitor translation file sizes in build reports
  - Consider splitting translations by feature/page (lazy loading)
  - Implement translation file compression
  - Add bundle size limits in CI/CD
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Lighthouse performance audit
  - Bundle size analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer
  - Load testing with various translation file sizes
- **Residual Risk:** Low - Next.js optimizes imports automatically
- **Owner:** Dev
- **Timeline:** Monitor after launch, optimize if needed

---

#### TECH-002: Middleware Locale Detection Edge Cases
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability:** Medium - Browser detection can be unpredictable
**Impact:** Medium - Users may see wrong language initially

**Description:**
Middleware uses `localeDetection: true` which relies on Accept-Language headers. Edge cases include VPN users, corporate proxies, and browsers with non-standard locale settings.

**Affected Components:**
- `middleware.ts`
- Locale cookie handling
- Default locale fallback

**Mitigation Strategy:** Detective + Corrective
- **Actions:**
  - Add logging for locale detection decisions
  - Provide clear language switcher on first visit
  - Respect user's explicit language choice over browser detection
  - Add analytics tracking for locale switching patterns
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Test with various Accept-Language headers
  - Test locale persistence across sessions
  - Test fallback behavior for unsupported locales
- **Residual Risk:** Low - next-intl handles most edge cases
- **Owner:** Dev
- **Timeline:** Add logging before launch

---

### LOW PRIORITY

#### TECH-003: Missing Translation Key Fallback Behavior
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability:** Low - Development will catch most missing keys
**Impact:** Medium - Could show raw keys to users

**Description:**
If a translation key exists in one locale but not the other, the behavior depends on next-intl configuration. Current implementation may show raw keys or default values.

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive
- **Actions:**
  - Configure next-intl to show locale-missing warnings in dev
  - Add translation coverage tests
  - Create translation file validation script
  - Document translation key naming conventions
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Unit tests for missing key scenarios
  - Visual regression testing for both locales
- **Residual Risk:** Very Low
- **Owner:** Dev
- **Timeline:** Add to dev workflow

---

#### BUS-002: Incomplete Translation Coverage at Launch
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability:** Low - Current scope is limited
**Impact:** Medium - Could lead to mixed-language UI

**Description:**
Initial translation files only cover navigation and common terms. As features are added, maintaining translation parity becomes a process challenge.

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive + Detective
- **Actions:**
  - Create translation coverage checklist for new features
  - Assign translation responsibility to feature owners
  - Add translation review to PR checklist
  - Consider translation management system (e.g., Crowdin)
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Manual translation review before each release
  - Automated translation key coverage reports
- **Residual Risk:** Medium - Requires process discipline
- **Owner:** Product + Dev
- **Timeline:** Establish process before Epic 2

---

#### SEC-001: Locale Parameter Injection Vulnerability
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability:** Low - Next.js validates route params
**Impact:** Medium - Could lead to path traversal

**Description:**
The `locale` parameter is used in dynamic imports (`@/messages/${locale}.json`). While Next.js validates route params, improper handling could theoretically lead to path traversal.

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive
- **Actions:**
  - Use `generateStaticParams()` to whitelist valid locales
  - Add explicit locale validation in layout
  - Never use locale param in file system operations without validation
  - Return 404 for invalid locales (already implemented)
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Security testing with invalid locale values (e.g., `../`, `..\\`, etc.)
  - Unit tests for locale validation
- **Residual Risk:** Very Low - Next.js provides strong protection
- **Owner:** Dev
- **Timeline:** Current implementation is secure

---

#### OPS-001: Translation File Sync Across Deployments
**Score: 1 (Minimal)**
**Probability:** Low - Files are in Git
**Impact:** Low - Minor inconvenience

**Description:**
Translation files are checked into Git, which is correct. However, if multiple developers work on translations simultaneously, merge conflicts could occur.

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive
- **Actions:**
  - Use JSON formatting tools to minimize diff noise
  - Sort translation keys alphabetically
  - Document translation file ownership
  - Consider feature-based translation file splits if needed
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - JSON validation in pre-commit hooks
- **Residual Risk:** Very Low
- **Owner:** Dev
- **Timeline:** Add JSON formatting to linting

---
